# Deliverable 2 - Akif Eltahir

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze the trends of certain stocks in the stock market, particularily DQ; so Steve can give his parents the best financial advice possible regarding their investments. Steve wants to expand his research to include the last few years to give his parents even more accurate advice. To do this, I will refactor the Module 2 solution code with the aim of completing the analysis more efficiently.

## Results

In 2017, all stocks except for TERP yielded a net-positive return regarding total daily volume. Steve's parents' stock of interest, DQ, did exceptionally well, yielding a return of 199.9% and a total daily volume of 35,796,200.

## Summary

### Question 1: What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring code include increasing the speed for completing complicated code, bugs are found faster and the software runs more efficiently. Disadvantages of refactoring code include refactoring code will not add any additional functionality to the original code and the time it takes to refactor code may not be worth it in the long end.

### Question 2: How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
These pros apply to the refactoring of the original VBA script because the refactored code does run much faster (see earlier screenshots). The cons apply because the code runs the exact same processes as the original without any additional outputs.
